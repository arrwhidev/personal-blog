Davie, Kev & Joey AKA Bear’s Den invited me to spend a day in the studio with them to visually document the recording of their first album, Islands.

The whole day was very candid and I think it really shows in the photos. You’ll see that quite a few of the photos are grainy and soft due to low lighting in the studio but personally I think that adds character and honesty to the story.

Islands is out now and it’s fantastic, go and get it!

Enjoy.
