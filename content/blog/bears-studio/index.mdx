Davie, Kev & Joey AKA Bear’s Den invited me to spend a day in the studio with them to visually document the recording of their first album, Islands.

The entire day was extremely candid and relaxed, it really shows in the photos. Due to the low light in the studio most of the photos are grainy and soft, I believe this adds character and honesty to the story.

Islands is out now and it’s fantastic, go and get it.

Enjoy.
