Working remotely offers many benefits, but face time with your colleagues is also important. The company I work for, [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/), is a fully remote company that also recognises the importance of meeting in person by offering a yearly budget to work together with your peers. For me, this is my ideal working environment. The benefits of being remote, with the opportunity to travel, meet new people, and explore new places on a regular basis.

Obviously, travelling has been on hold through the pandemic, but as the world has started to slowly open again we took the opportunity to organize a team meetup in Amsterdam. I'm thankful that this trip was possible as I had the privilege of meeting some folks that I've been working with for over a year that I had not met in person, as well as some newer Hotjarians too.

Please enjoy a few of my favourite photos from this trip.

# Don't forget your coat üåßÔ∏è

Even when wet, Amsterdam is a beautiful city.

# Here comes the sun üåû

If you've been to the Netherlands, you will know how fast the weather changes; and the city is equally beautiful when the sun starts to shine.

# Work üë®‚Äçüíª 

We worked for a couple of days from [Mindspace](https://www.mindspace.me/l/dam), a great co-working space with decent coffee.

One of the folks who lives in Amsterdam was generous enough to host us for a day, and we got to meet his rotund cat.
